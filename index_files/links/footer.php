<p> This site is meant to be open source, take whatever you want. The source will be uploaded <a href="#">here</a> eventually. All I ask is that you don't claim work as your own and if you make money off it I wouldn't mind some, I'm a broke college student.

Giving credit where credit is due this footer came from this <a href="http://fortysevenmedia.com/blog/archives/making_your_footer_stay_put_with_css/" target="_blank">tutorial</a>. It is a very nifty design and works very well with my site.
